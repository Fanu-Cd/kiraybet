- Tenants (house seekers) can create accounts, view houses using a robust filtering system which supports filtering by parameters and shows results as listings and locations on a map, communicate with owners with a real time chat system, save houses for future actions, and give complaints or ratings on houses. If a tenant wants to contact the owner via phone number, that is also possible as the system shows the owner's contact info.
